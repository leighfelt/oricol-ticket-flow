### Quick Installation (Cloud - Supabase Free Tier)

**Note:** For local development, use the Quick Start above. This section is for cloud deployment.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/craigfelt/oricol-ticket-flow-34e64301.git
   cd oricol-ticket-flow-34e64301
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup (Cloud Only)**
   
   If using cloud Supabase, update the `.env` file with your cloud credentials.
   The file is pre-configured for local development by default.
   
   For cloud setup, edit `.env` and uncomment the cloud section:
   ```env
   # Comment out the local settings and uncomment these:
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-anon-key>
   VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
   ```
   
   Get these from your free Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

4. **Apply Database Migrations (Cloud Only)**
   ```sh
   npm run migrate
   ```
   
   This applies all database schema changes. See [SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS.md](./SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS.md) for details.
   
   **For local development:** Migrations are applied automatically when you run `npm run supabase:start`

5. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at http://localhost:8080

6. **Build for production**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

### Local Development - Complete Guide

For the complete local development setup with all details, see **[QUICK_LOCAL_SETUP.md](./QUICK_LOCAL_SETUP.md)**

Key local development commands:
```sh
npm run supabase:start    # Start local Supabase
npm run supabase:stop     # Stop local Supabase (keeps data)
npm run supabase:status   # Check if Supabase is running
npm run supabase:reset    # Reset database (deletes all data)
npm run dev               # Start the frontend app
```

### Quick Installation (Local - 100% Free, No Cloud)

**This is now the default setup!** The `.env` file is pre-configured for local development.

1. **Clone and install**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/craigfelt/oricol-ticket-flow-34e64301.git
   cd oricol-ticket-flow-34e64301
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start local Supabase** (requires Docker)
   ```sh
   npm run supabase:start
   ```
   
   This starts a complete local Supabase instance with database, auth, and storage.
   The default configuration in `.env` already has the correct local credentials!

3. **Start the app**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
   
   Access Supabase Studio (database admin) at http://localhost:54323

**No additional configuration needed!** The `.env` file is already set up for local development.
   Access Supabase Studio (database admin) at http://localhost:54323
