🔍 HOW TO FIND YOUR SUPABASE CONNECTION
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  You're using this Lovable app and need to know which Supabase instance
  it's connected to. You may have added a Supabase integration manually,
  but you're not sure if that's the one being used.

SOLUTION:
  This PR adds a Settings page to your app and comprehensive documentation
  to help you identify and manage your Supabase connection.

HOW TO USE:
================================================================================

STEP 1 - View Your Current Supabase Configuration:
  1. Deploy this branch to Lovable (or run locally)
  2. Navigate to: /settings in your app
     Example: https://your-app.lovable.app/settings
  3. The page will show:
     - Current Supabase Project ID
     - Supabase URL
     - Connection status
     - Whether credentials are configured

STEP 2 - Find Your Supabase Project:
  Based on your config, your Project ID is: kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp
  
  1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
  2. Look for a project with ID: kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp
  3. If you find it - that's your live Supabase instance!
  4. If you don't find it - see the documentation below

STEP 3 - Verify in Lovable:
  1. Open your Lovable project dashboard
  2. Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
  3. Check these variables:
     - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
     - VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
     - VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  4. These values determine which Supabase instance is actually used

COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE:
================================================================================
  Read the full guide: FIND_YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION.md
  
  This document covers:
  - 4 different methods to verify your Supabase connection
  - Understanding auto-provisioned vs. manual Supabase setup
  - How to switch Supabase projects
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Lovable-specific instructions

WHAT'S NEW IN THIS PR:
================================================================================
  ✅ New /settings page showing your Supabase configuration
  ✅ Settings link added to navigation menu (visible to all users)
  ✅ Comprehensive guide: FIND_YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION.md
  ✅ Connection status checking
  ✅ Quick links to Supabase dashboard
  ✅ Copy-to-clipboard for Project ID and URL

UNDERSTANDING YOUR SETUP:
================================================================================

Scenario A - Lovable Auto-Provisioned Supabase:
  When you created your Lovable project, it may have automatically created
  a Supabase project for you. This project might not appear in your personal
  Supabase dashboard until you accept an invitation.
  
  ➡️ Check your email for Supabase invitations
  ➡️ Or contact Lovable support for access

Scenario B - Manual Supabase Integration:
  You added a Supabase integration in Lovable's Integrations tab, connecting
  your own Supabase project.
  
  ⚠️ NOTE: Adding an integration doesn't automatically update environment
  variables! You need to manually update:
    - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
    - VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  
  ➡️ Go to Lovable Settings → Environment Variables to update these

Scenario C - Conflicting Connections:
  Lovable created an auto-provisioned Supabase, but you also added your own
  Supabase integration. The environment variables determine which one is used.
  
  ➡️ Check environment variables in Lovable
  ➡️ Decide which Supabase to use
  ➡️ Update environment variables accordingly
  ➡️ Run migrations on the correct instance

QUICK REFERENCE:
================================================================================
  Your current configuration:
    Project ID:   kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp
    Supabase URL: https://kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp.supabase.co

  Access your Supabase dashboard:
    https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp

  If the project doesn't exist in your dashboard:
    1. Check email for Supabase invitations
    2. Contact Lovable support
    3. Or switch to your own Supabase project (see guide)

TESTING THE CHANGES:
================================================================================
  1. Navigate to /settings in your app
  2. Verify the connection status shows "Connected"
  3. Verify the Project ID matches: kwmeqvrmtivmljujwocp
  4. Click the "Open in Supabase" button
  5. Confirm it opens your Supabase project
